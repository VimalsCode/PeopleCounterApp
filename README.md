## Requirements

### Hardware

* 6th to 10th generation Intel® Core™ processor with Iris® Pro graphics or Intel® HD Graphics.
* OR use of Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2)
* OR Udacity classroom workspace for the related course

### Software

*   Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2019 R3 release
*   Node v6.17.1
*   Npm v3.10.10
*   CMake
*   MQTT Mosca server
  
        
## Setup

### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit

Utilize the classroom workspace, or refer to the relevant instructions for your operating system for this step.

- [Linux/Ubuntu](./linux-setup.md)
- [Mac](./mac-setup.md)
- [Windows](./windows-setup.md)

### Install Nodejs and its dependencies

Utilize the classroom workspace, or refer to the relevant instructions for your operating system for this step.

- [Linux/Ubuntu](./linux-setup.md)
- [Mac](./mac-setup.md)
- [Windows](./windows-setup.md)

### Install npm

There are three components that need to be running in separate terminals for this application to work:

-   MQTT Mosca server 
-   Node.js* Web server
-   FFmpeg server
     
From the main directory:

* For MQTT/Mosca server:
   ```
   cd webservice/server
   npm install
   ```

* For Web server:
  ```
  cd ../ui
  npm install
  ```
  **Note:** If any configuration errors occur in mosca server or Web server while using **npm install**, use the below commands:
   ```
   sudo npm install npm -g 
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean
   npm config set registry "http://registry.npmjs.org"
   npm install
   ```

## What model to use

It is up to you to decide on what model to use for the application. You need to find a model not already converted to Intermediate Representation format (i.e. not one of the Intel® Pre-Trained Models), convert it, and utilize the converted model in your application.

Note that you may need to do additional processing of the output to handle incorrect detections, such as adjusting confidence threshold or accounting for 1-2 frames where the model fails to see a person already counted and would otherwise double count.

**If you are otherwise unable to find a suitable model after attempting and successfully converting at least three other models**, you can document in your write-up what the models were, how you converted them, and why they failed, and then utilize any of the Intel® Pre-Trained Models that may perform better.

## Run the application

From the main directory:

### Step 1 - Start the Mosca server

```
cd webservice/server/node-server
node ./server.js
```

You should see the following message, if successful:
```
Mosca server started.
```

### Step 2 - Start the GUI

Open new terminal and run below commands.
```
cd webservice/ui
npm run dev
```

You should see the following message in the terminal.
```
webpack: Compiled successfully
```

### Step 3 - FFmpeg Server

Open new terminal and run the below commands.
```
sudo ffserver -f ./ffmpeg/server.conf
```

### Step 4 - Run the code

Open a new terminal to run the code. 

#### Setup the environment

You must configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit one time per session by running the following command:
```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.5
```
